# homework9
created all routes in new folder with individual js files
By doing so I made the code look better and cleaner without everything being on one js
Also attempted to do delete fucntionality but didn't
All API routes are called correctly and deployed site to heroku
Also only have one push because with the help of a tutor through GWU I was able to complete the assignment with one commit
That is why only one commit is seen 
Thank you!
